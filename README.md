# picture-organizer
This program organizes the pictures from a certain folder based on the month and year they were taken. The user chooses which folder to organize using the console. From there, the program searches through the sub-folders of their choosen folder for photos. The photos are renamed to the date they were taken. Those that cannot be renamed (.png and .gif files), are placed in a Misc folder. The photos that were renamed are placed in the folders corresponding to year and month.
Made using Python and PIL Library.
